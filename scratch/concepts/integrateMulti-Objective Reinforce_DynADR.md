To integrate **Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL)** with **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for your centralized ADR controller in a LoRaWAN network, we need to design the RL system that can balance multiple objectives such as **Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)** and **Energy Consumption**. Below is an outline of how you can implement the **MORL with DQN** in the context of LoRaWAN ADR optimization.

### 1. **Action Space**
The action space consists of the possible **Spreading Factor (SF)** and **Transmission Power (TP)** values. Since **SF** and **TP** are discrete, the action space is finite and predefined. For example, you may have the following action sets:

- **SF Options**: \{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\} (6 possible values)
- **TP Options**: \{5, 10, 15, 20\} (4 possible values)

Thus, the total action space size is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) discrete actions.

### 2. **State Space**
The state space is defined based on the **network condition**. Some of the features that can be used to define the state include:
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**
- **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)**
- **End Device (ED) battery level**
- **Network congestion (i.e., number of nodes in the current communication range)**
- **Last transmission success/failure**

The state could be represented as a vector of these features, which will be used to input to the DQN.

### 3. **Reward Function**
The reward function should be a combination of **Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)** and **Energy Consumption**. Since we are implementing **Multi-Objective RL (MORL)**, we aim to optimize these two conflicting objectives simultaneously. The reward can be formulated as:

$R = \alpha \times PDR - \beta \times EnergyConsumption$


Where:
- PDR is the percentage of successful packet transmissions.
- EnergyConsumption is the total energy consumed by the device during packet transmission.
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are weighting factors that determine the relative importance of PDR and energy consumption.

Since we have two objectives, the reward can also be represented as a **vector**:

$R = \left[ \alpha \times PDR, -\beta \times EnergyConsumption \right]$

The RL agent will learn to balance both rewards to maximize overall system performance.

### 4. **Deep Q-Network (DQN) Architecture**
For the **MORL with DQN** approach:
- The **Q-function** is approximated by a neural network \( Q(s, a) \), where \( s \) is the state and \( a \) is the action.
- The neural network outputs **Q-values** for each action given the current state.
- The DQN is trained to minimize the **loss function** using the Bellman equation:

$L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \left( r + \gamma \max_a Q'(s', a'; \theta^-) - Q(s, a; \theta) \right)^2 \right]$

where:
  - $\theta$ is the parameters of the current Q-network.
  - $\theta^-$ is the parameters of the target Q-network (which is updated periodically).
  - \( r \) is the reward obtained for taking action \( a \) from state \( s \), transitioning to \( s' \), and receiving reward \( r \).

### 5. **Interaction with NS3 via Socket Programming**
To integrate the **MORL with DQN** into your **NS3 simulation**, we use socket programming to interact with the environment:

- **Action Transmission**: After each packet transmission, the **NS3 simulator** sends the current **SF** and **TP** values to the **Python trainer** via a socket.
- **Reward Calculation**: The **Python RL trainer** computes the reward based on **PDR** and **Energy Consumption** for the specific transmission.
- **Policy Update**: The trainer updates the Q-values using the **MORL reward** and sends the updated action back to the **NS3 simulator** for the next transmission.

### 6. **Algorithm Steps**
1. **Initialize the Q-network**: Initialize a neural network with random weights to approximate the Q-function.
2. **Loop through simulation steps**:
    - **Receive state** from NS3 (e.g., SNR, RSSI, network congestion).
    - **Select action**: Use an epsilon-greedy strategy to select an action (SF, TP).
    - **Execute action** in the NS3 simulator: Update the simulation parameters (SF, TP) accordingly.
    - **Observe reward**: NS3 reports the **PDR** and **Energy Consumption** based on the action.
    - **Update Q-network**: Perform a gradient descent step on the Q-network to minimize the loss function and update the action-value function.
3. **Repeat until convergence**: The trainer continually improves the Q-function and updates the ADR policy to optimize PDR and energy consumption.

### 7. **Code Example (Python)**

Here is a simplified Python code example using **TensorFlow/Keras** for the DQN network with MORL:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import socket

# Define the DQN model
def build_dqn(input_shape, action_space):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(action_space, activation='linear')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Initialize Q-network
input_shape = (4,)  # Example state space (SNR, RSSI, battery, network load)
action_space = 24  # Number of possible actions (SF and TP combinations)
q_network = build_dqn(input_shape, action_space)

# Define socket connection to NS3
host = 'localhost'
port = 12345
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

# Epsilon-greedy strategy
epsilon = 0.1

# Training loop
for episode in range(1000):
    state = np.array([0.5, -120, 0.8, 0.3])  # Example state (SNR, RSSI, battery, load)
    
    # Epsilon-greedy action selection
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        action = np.random.choice(action_space)
    else:
        action = np.argmax(q_network.predict(state.reshape(1, -1)))
    
    # Send action to NS3 (SF, TP)
    sock.sendto(str(action).encode(), (host, port))
    
    # Receive reward from NS3
    reward_data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)
    reward = np.array([float(x) for x in reward_data.decode().split(',')])
    
    # Update Q-network
    target = reward + 0.99 * np.max(q_network.predict(state.reshape(1, -1)))
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        q_values = q_network(state.reshape(1, -1))
        loss = tf.reduce_mean((target - q_values[0, action])**2)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, q_network.trainable_variables)
    q_network.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, q_network.trainable_variables))

    print(f"Episode {episode}, Action: {action}, Reward: {reward}")
```

### 8. **NS3 Integration**
The NS3 implementation will handle the communication between the RL agent and the simulation environment. It will listen for UDP messages and update the simulation parameters based on the actions sent by the Python trainer.

---

### Summary of Implementation Steps:
1. **State and Action Representation**: Define your state and action space (SF and TP values).
2. **Reward Function**: Combine the PDR and energy consumption into a multi-objective reward.
3. **DQN with MORL**: Implement DQN to optimize both PDR and energy consumption using MORL.
4. **Socket Communication**: Establish a socket connection between NS3 and Python to send actions and receive rewards.
5. **Training**: Continuously train the DQN to improve the ADR policy by balancing the objectives.

This approach should allow you to dynamically optimize the ADR parameters (SF, TP) in real-time during NS3 simulations, based on both packet delivery and energy consumption, using **MORL** and **DQN**.
