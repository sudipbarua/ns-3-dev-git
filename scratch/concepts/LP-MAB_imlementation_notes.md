Implementing the LP-MAB algorithm in Python and integrating it with NS-3 involves several steps. Below, I'll provide a Python implementation of the LP-MAB algorithm and a basic socket program to communicate with NS-3. This setup will allow the RL program to train and interact with the NS-3 simulator.

### Step 1: Python Implementation of LP-MAB

```python
import numpy as np
import random
import socket

class LP_MAB:
    def __init__(self, num_actions, gamma=0.1):
        self.num_actions = num_actions
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.weights = np.ones(num_actions)
        self.probabilities = np.ones(num_actions) / num_actions
        self.action_counts = np.zeros(num_actions)

    def select_action(self):
        action = np.random.choice(self.num_actions, p=self.probabilities)
        return action

    def update(self, action, reward):
        self.action_counts[action] += 1
        estimated_reward = reward / self.probabilities[action]
        self.weights[action] *= np.exp(self.gamma * estimated_reward / self.num_actions)
        self.probabilities = (1 - self.gamma) * (self.weights / np.sum(self.weights)) + self.gamma / self.num_actions
        self.probabilities /= np.sum(self.probabilities)

def start_socket_server(host='localhost', port=12345):
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind((host, port))
    server_socket.listen(1)
    print(f"Listening on {host}:{port}...")
    return server_socket

def handle_client_connection(client_socket, lp_mab):
    while True:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
        if not data:
            break
        action, reward = map(int, data.split(','))
        lp_mab.update(action, reward)
        next_action = lp_mab.select_action()
        client_socket.send(str(next_action).encode())
    client_socket.close()

def main():
    num_actions = 10  # Example number of actions
    lp_mab = LP_MAB(num_actions)
    server_socket = start_socket_server()
    while True:
        client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connection from {addr}")
        handle_client_connection(client_socket, lp_mab)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 2: NS-3 Integration

To integrate the LP-MAB algorithm with NS-3, you need to set up a socket connection from NS-3 to the Python server. Below is a basic example of how you might set up the NS-3 side using C++.

```cpp
#include "ns3/core-module.h"
#include "ns3/network-module.h"
#include "ns3/internet-module.h"
#include "ns3/applications-module.h"
#include "ns3/socket.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace ns3;

void SendToPythonServer(Ptr<Socket> socket, uint32_t action, uint32_t reward) {
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << action << "," << reward;
    std::string message = ss.str();
    Ptr<Packet> packet = Create<Packet>((uint8_t*)message.c_str(), message.size());
    socket->Send(packet);
}

void ReceiveFromPythonServer(Ptr<Socket> socket) {
    Ptr<Packet> packet;
    while ((packet = socket->Recv())) {
        uint8_t buffer[1024];
        packet->CopyData(buffer, packet->GetSize());
        std::string response((char*)buffer, packet->GetSize());
        uint32_t next_action = std::stoi(response);
        std::cout << "Next action: " << next_action << std::endl;
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    CommandLine cmd;
    cmd.Parse(argc, argv);

    Ptr<Socket> socket = Socket::CreateSocket(GetNode(), TcpSocketFactory::GetTypeId());
    InetSocketAddress remote = InetSocketAddress(Ipv4Address("127.0.0.1"), 12345);
    socket->Connect(remote);

    uint32_t action = 0; // Example action
    uint32_t reward = 1; // Example reward

    SendToPythonServer(socket, action, reward);
    ReceiveFromPythonServer(socket);

    Simulator::Run();
    Simulator::Destroy();
    return 0;
}
```

### Step 3: Running the Simulation

1. **Start the Python server**: Run the Python script to start the socket server.
2. **Run the NS-3 simulation**: Compile and run the NS-3 simulation. Ensure that the NS-3 script connects to the Python server using the specified IP and port.

### Notes

- **Action and Reward**: The action and reward should be defined based on your specific simulation scenario. The example provided uses simple integers.
- **Socket Communication**: Ensure that the socket communication is correctly set up and that both the Python server and NS-3 client can send and receive data.
- **Integration**: This is a basic example. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to adjust the action selection, reward calculation, and socket communication logic.

This setup should allow you to train the LP-MAB algorithm using the NS-3 simulator. Adjust the parameters and logic as needed for your specific application.

### Example Using `MABWiser`

Here’s an example of how you can use the `MABWiser` library to implement a simple MAB algorithm:

```python
from mabwiser.mab import MAB, LearningPolicy, NeighborhoodPolicy
import numpy as np

# Define the number of arms (actions)
num_arms = 10

# Initialize the MAB with the EXP3 learning policy
mab = MAB(arms=range(num_arms), learning_policy=LearningPolicy.EXP3())

# Simulate some rewards
rewards = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_arms)

# Train the MAB
for arm in range(num_arms):
    mab.learn(decisions=[arm], rewards=[rewards[arm]])

# Predict the best arm
best_arm = mab.predict()
print(f"Best arm: {best_arm}")
```

### Example Using `scikit-bandit`

Here’s an example of how you can use the `scikit-bandit` library to implement a simple MAB algorithm:

```python
from skbandit import Bandit
import numpy as np

# Define the number of arms (actions)
num_arms = 10

# Initialize the Bandit with the UCB1 policy
bandit = Bandit(n_arms=num_arms, policy='UCB1')

# Simulate some rewards
rewards = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_arms)

# Train the Bandit
for arm in range(num_arms):
    bandit.update(arm, rewards[arm])

# Predict the best arm
best_arm = bandit.predict()
print(f"Best arm: {best_arm}")
```

### Integrating with NS-3

To integrate these libraries with NS-3, you can follow a similar approach as before, using socket communication to send actions and rewards between the NS-3 simulator and the Python script. Here’s a basic example using `MABWiser`:

```python
import socket
from mabwiser.mab import MAB, LearningPolicy

class MABServer:
    def __init__(self, num_arms):
        self.mab = MAB(arms=range(num_arms), learning_policy=LearningPolicy.EXP3())

    def start_server(self, host='localhost', port=12345):
        server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        server_socket.bind((host, port))
        server_socket.listen(1)
        print(f"Listening on {host}:{port}...")
        return server_socket

    def handle_client(self, client_socket):
        while True:
            data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
            if not data:
                break
            action, reward = map(int, data.split(','))
            self.mab.learn(decisions=[action], rewards=[reward])
            next_action = self.mab.predict()
            client_socket.send(str(next_action).encode())
        client_socket.close()

def main():
    num_arms = 10
    mab_server = MABServer(num_arms)
    server_socket = mab_server.start_server()
    while True:
        client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connection from {addr}")
        mab_server.handle_client(client_socket)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion

Using libraries like `MABWiser` or `scikit-bandit` can simplify the implementation of MAB algorithms and provide more robust and optimized solutions. You can integrate these libraries with NS-3 using socket communication, as shown in the examples. This approach allows you to leverage the power of Python libraries while running simulations in NS-3.
